        # Both: Each of us must create a branch, make at least 3 commits, and open a pull request, and write all documentation.
               # At least one merge conflict must be resolved (intentionally if needed)
                     # One “safe” way to do this is both of you editing the README’s introduction

# Review before submitting on Canvas on Friday, Sept 12th
      # Both Cecilia and Jenna check that there are the following in Cecilia_Jenna_DSE511 Repo:
          # data/folder with clean dataset
          # notebooks/ folder with analysis code
          # README.md
      # Cecilia and Jenna each submit a copy of Repo URL to Canvas

# Framework created by Cecilia on 9/4/25 based on Homework3.pdf
